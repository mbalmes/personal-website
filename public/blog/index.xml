      <title>I ain&#39;t scared of no vendor lock-in</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t use functions or we&amp;rsquo;ll be stuck with Azure.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t use cognito or we&amp;rsquo;ll be with AWS forever.&amp;rdquo;
I hear it all the time. Vendor lock-in is going to be the scariest halloween costume for a cloud engineer this halloween season. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying vendor lock-in isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s costing some big companies a lot of money. But, I&amp;rsquo;m not one of them. Avoiding vendor lock-in is expensive, really expensive, for small to medium sized cloud users.</description>

      <title>Serverless: still no such thing as a silver bullet</title>

      <description>Serverless is the new hotness right now, which means everyone is using it for everything and getting upset that isn&amp;rsquo;t some magical wand that solves all their problems. For example, cardgames.io switched from Elastic Beanstalk to Lambdas and saw their bills go up and response time get worse. Isn&amp;rsquo;t the whole point of serverless that the built in autoscaling saves money and helps with performance?
When I talk about serverless, I tell people serverless is like Uber and everything else is like owning a car.</description>
