      <description>I feel betrayed. I let Amazon Alexa into my house and let her listen to all my amazing conversations that I have and all I ask is that she turns on the lights for me. But, now half the time I ask her to &amp;ldquo;turn on all my lights&amp;rdquo; she response &amp;ldquo;sorry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a device called northern lights&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;which one did you mean?&amp;rdquo; She used to work so amazing, but has gotten progressively worse over time.</description>

      <title>Serverless: still no such thing as a silver bullet</title>

      <description>Serverless is the new hotness right now, which means everyone is using it for everything and getting upset that isn&amp;rsquo;t some magical wand that solves all their problems. For example, cardgames.io switched from Elastic Beanstalk to Lambdas and saw their bills go up and response time get worse. But, isn&amp;rsquo;t the whole point of serverless that the built in autoscaling should save money and helps with performance?
When I talk about serverless, I tell people serverless is like Uber and everything else is like driving a car.</description>
