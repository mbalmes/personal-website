      <title>Serverless: still no such thing as a silver bullet</title>

      <description>Serverless is the new hotness right now, which means everyone is using it for everything and getting upset that isn&amp;rsquo;t some magical wand that solves all their problems. For example, cardgames.io switched from Elastic Beanstalk to Lambdas and saw their bills go up and response time get worse. But, isn&amp;rsquo;t the whole point of serverless that the built in autoscaling should save money and helps with performance?
When I talk about serverless, I tell people serverless is like Uber and everything else is like driving a car.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Michael Balmes I like surrounding myself with people smarter than me to make amazing software. I have a passion for cloud infrastructure, but I&amp;rsquo;m interested in all types of software. I believe in the principles of software craftsmanship and building stable, tested software. I cut my teeth on the LAMP stack when I was 14 years old, but as an adult I like to write C#, JavaScript, and Python.</description>
