# Hi, I'm Michael Balmes

I like surronding myself with people smarter than me to make amazing software. I have a passion for cloud infrastructure, but I'm interested in all types of software. I believe in the principles of software craftmanship and building stable, tested software. I cut my teeth on the LAMP stack when I was 14 years old, but as an adult I like to write C#, JavaScript, and Python. Let me know if you would like to build some amazing things together.
